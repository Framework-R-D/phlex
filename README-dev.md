## On GitHub Copilot

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` contains various "ground rules" to be observed by GitHub Copilot for every session. They are intended to be useful for everyone, but you can override or augment them yourself by creating a `<workspace>/.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. If this file exists, its contents will be merged with—but take precedence over—the repository level instructions.

The instructions in this file were created not by hand, but by asking Copilot to produce instructions for itself to achieve a goal, such as, "Please update the instructions file to ensure adherence to `markdown-lint` rules when generating Markdown files." This way (hopefully), the instructions are more likely to have the intended effect on the AI since they were generated by the AI itself.

If you wish to add your own personalized instructions, or adjust/augment the repository-level instructions via PR, best results will be achieved by following this method rather than writing them yourself except in the most trivial of cases.
