# Notes for Developers of Phlex

## On GitHub Copilot

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file contains "ground rules" for GitHub Copilot sessions. To override or augment these, create a `<workspace>/.github/copilot-instructions.md` file; its contents will be merged with and take precedence over the repository-level instructions.

These instructions were generated by asking Copilot to produce instructions for itself to achieve a goal, such as, "Please update the instructions file to ensure adherence to `markdown-lint` rules when generating Markdown files." This method is intended to make the instructions more effective for the AI.

For best results when adding or adjusting instructions, follow this method rather than writing them manually, except in the most trivial cases.

## Local Environment Setup

The canonical way to initialise the Phlex toolchain is to source `scripts/setup-env.sh` (or `srcs/phlex/scripts/setup-env.sh` inside a multi-project workspace). See `scripts/README.md` for a full walkthrough and `scripts/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for a condensed cheat sheet.

## CMake Presets

Project presets live in `CMakePresets.json` and cover common scenarios such as the default development build and the `coverage-gcc`/`coverage-clang` configurations. Prefer invoking CMake through these presets:

```bash
cmake --preset default -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j $(nproc)
```

Presets keep developer and CI builds aligned and ensure the generated `compile_commands.json` matches what our static-analysis tooling expects.
