Convert selected tests to Catch2 framework

Converted 3 C++ test files from manual assertion-based testing to Catch2,
improving test structure and consistency with the rest of the test suite.

Files converted:
- test/identifier.cpp: 5 test cases for identifier operations
- test/type_id.cpp: 7 test cases for type ID functionality
- test/yielding_driver.cpp: 1 test case for async driver with TBB

Changes:
- Replaced assert() with CHECK()/REQUIRE() macros
- Organized tests into logical TEST_CASE blocks
- Removed manual print statements in favor of Catch2 reporting
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to use USE_CATCH2_MAIN
- Preserved all static_assert statements for compile-time checks

Evaluation:
- Evaluated 13 non-Catch2 test files
- Converted 3 tests that benefit from structured test cases
- Kept 10 tests as-is (compile-time only, integration tests, etc.)
- Added CATCH2_CONVERSION_EVALUATION.md documenting decisions

Benefits:
- Better failure reporting with detailed diagnostics
- Clearer test organization and maintainability
- Consistency with project testing standards
- Easier to add new test cases

All tests maintain 100% of original coverage with improved structure.
