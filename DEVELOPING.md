# Phlex developer notes

## Contributions

_[The contribution policy is currently under development.]_

Except in rare circumstances, changes to the `phlex` repository are proposed and considered through GitHub pull requests (PRs).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Both external contributors and framework developers are expected to abide by this contribution policy.
> - Even if you are a contributor with merge privileges, your PR should be reviewed by someone else before being merged into the `main` branch.

## Building with Coverage

Phlex supports comprehensive code coverage measurement using CMake's built-in coverage support:

```bash
# Configure with coverage enabled
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON /path/to/phlex/source

# Build and run tests
cmake --build . -j $(nproc)
ctest -j $(nproc)

# Generate coverage reports
ninja coverage-xml    # XML report for CI/Codecov
ninja coverage-html   # HTML report for local viewing
ninja coverage        # Basic coverage info via ctest
ninja coverage-clean  # Clean coverage data files
```

The coverage system:

- Uses GCC's built-in `gcov` for instrumentation
- Generates reports with `gcovr` (XML) and `lcov` (HTML)
- Automatically filters to project sources only
- Handles known GCC coverage bugs gracefully
- Integrates with VS Code coverage extensions

### Using the Coverage Script

For convenience, the `scripts/coverage.sh` script automates the entire coverage workflow:

```bash
# Complete workflow (recommended)
./scripts/coverage.sh all

# Individual commands
./scripts/coverage.sh setup       # Configure and build with coverage
./scripts/coverage.sh test        # Run tests with coverage
./scripts/coverage.sh xml         # Generate XML report
./scripts/coverage.sh html        # Generate HTML report
./scripts/coverage.sh view        # Open HTML report in browser
./scripts/coverage.sh summary     # Show coverage summary
./scripts/coverage.sh upload      # Upload to Codecov

# Chain multiple commands
./scripts/coverage.sh setup test html view
```

**Important**: Coverage data becomes stale when source files change. Always rebuild before generating reports:

```bash
./scripts/coverage.sh setup test html  # Rebuild → test → generate HTML
```

The script automatically:

- Detects standalone vs. multi-project build configurations
- Sources environment setup scripts (`setup-env.sh`)
- Detects stale instrumentation and rebuilds when needed
- Handles generated source files via temporary symlink trees
- Normalizes coverage paths for Codecov compatibility

### Coverage and Generated Files

The coverage system handles generated C/C++ files (e.g., from code generators) by:

1. Creating a temporary symlink tree at `.coverage-generated/` in the repository root
2. Mapping build-directory paths to repository-relative paths using `--path-map`
3. Normalizing XML paths with `normalize_coverage_xml.py` before upload

This ensures Codecov can match coverage data to the correct files in your repository.

### VS Code Integration

After generating HTML coverage, the script copies `lcov.info` to the workspace root for VS Code extensions like Coverage Gutters. Install the extension and open any source file to see coverage indicators in the gutter.

### Uploading to Codecov

To upload coverage manually:

```bash
# Set your token (choose one method)
export CODECOV_TOKEN='your-token'
echo 'your-token' > ~/.codecov_token && chmod 600 ~/.codecov_token

# Upload
./scripts/coverage.sh xml upload
```

The upload command uses the Codecov CLI and automatically normalizes paths for repository compatibility.

## Coverage in CI

The project automatically runs coverage analysis on every PR and push to main/develop branches. The workflow:

1. Builds with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON`
2. Runs all tests via `ctest`
3. Generates XML coverage report using `cmake --build . --target coverage-xml`
4. Normalizes paths for generated files using `normalize_coverage_xml.py`
5. Uploads to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Framework-R-D/phlex) via `codecov/codecov-action@v4`

Coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov for tracking and PR integration, with automatic comments on PRs showing coverage changes.


## On GitHub Copilot

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` contains various "ground rules" to be observed by GitHub Copilot for every session. They are intended to be useful for everyone, but you can override or augment them yourself by creating a `<workspace>/.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. If this file exists, its contents will be merged with—but take precedence over—the repository level instructions.

The instructions in this file were created not by hand, but by asking Copilot to produce instructions for itself to achieve a goal, such as, "Please update the instructions file to ensure adherence to `markdown-lint` rules when generating Markdown files." This way (hopefully), the instructions are more likely to have the intended effect on the AI since they were generated by the AI itself.

If you wish to add your own personalized instructions, or adjust/augment the repository-level instructions via PR, best results will be achieved by following this method rather than writing them yourself except in the most trivial of cases.
