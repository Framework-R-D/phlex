"""
Minimal access to Phlex from cppyy.

cppyy needs access to core Phlex classes to complete the registration, which
is done through header parsing. Only the relevant header files are included
and no libraries are loaded as this module is only for use in the `phlex`
executable, which is already appropriately linked.
